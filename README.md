Hi there!

This is a short bit of CSS to indicate whether a link is to a paywalled news site.

This is done by using the a:hover state to show top level URLs (like The Times, the FT, the NYT etc), instead of using a symbol like Â£ or $.

The colour used is a tasteful and classy dollar green: #85bb65.

The obvious limitation for this is that the :hover attribute isn't great for mobile. However, will look at implementing some clever js or something. Who knows.

Do whatever you want with this code or idea - there's probably a neater implemenation out there.
