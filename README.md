#Paywall links CSS hack

##Hi there!

This is a short bit of CSS to indicate whether a link is to a paywalled news site, for general web browsing or in email newsletters etc (anywhere that uses HTML/CSS3). 

This is done by using the a:hover state to show top level URLs (like The Times, the FT, the NYT etc), instead of using a symbol like Â£ or $.

The colour used is a tasteful and classy dollar green: #85bb65. 

The obvious limitation for this is that the :hover attribute isn't great for mobile. However, might look at implementing some clever js or something. Who knows. Who bloody knows.

Do whatever you want with this code or idea - there's ~~probably~~ definitely a neater implemenation out there.
